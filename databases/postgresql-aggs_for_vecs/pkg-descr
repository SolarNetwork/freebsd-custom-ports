The aggs_for_vecs extension adds various aggregate functions like min,
max, avg, and var_samp that operate on arrays instead of scalers. It
treats each array as a "vector" and handles each element independently.
Similar behavior can be achieved by using UNNEST to break up the input
arrays and then array_agg to put the results back together, however
the aggs_for_vecs functions can be 5-10x faster.
